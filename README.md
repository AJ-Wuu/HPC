## Slurm (originally Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management)
### Log In: ```ssh awu53@euler.wacc.wisc.edu```
### Slurm used on Euler to share Eulerâ€™s hardware and software resources
* Uses a batch script as input -> **slurm is the name; ```sbatch``` is the utility**
* Partitions: Each partition has its own priority rules, job queue, hardware, and time limit (Euler uses partitions to enforce user priority)
